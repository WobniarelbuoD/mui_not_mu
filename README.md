My first well and proper react project with multiple tabs. It's a basic site that has a homepage with a link to a funny video, a calculator if you are too lazy to open up yours in your device, an incredible to do list i named "Task Master" with edit functionality (impressive i know) and last but not least a beautifully crafted masterpiece of text called the about page! Hint: you can try and type random paths in the url to find out how the world died.
